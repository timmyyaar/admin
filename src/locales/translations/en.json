One option is to purchase specialized cleaning products from the store, as the modern market offers a wide range of effective and affordable options for every surface. Alternatively, you can create your own grease-fighting solution using common household items. For instance, a mixture of baking soda and vegetable oil is ideal for tackling stubborn grease stains and polishing surfaces like countertops, laminated items, backsplashes, and wooden objects coated with lacquer or oil. Combine one and a half tablespoons of baking soda with one tablespoon of oil, apply to the stains, rub gently with a soft cloth, and then wipe away with a damp cloth.\n\nAnother common method involves using a solution of equal parts warm water and 6% vinegar, which can effectively remove localized grease stains from various surfaces. However, caution is advised when working with wood. You can also mix vinegar with isopropyl alcohol in a 7:1 ratio, adding a few drops of liquid soap to create a versatile solution for tackling kitchen grease. Additionally, some homemakers recommend mixing equal parts rubbing alcohol and warm water, being careful with wooden surfaces. After applying and removing the solution residue, allow the surfaces to dry completely before using the kitchen.\n\nFor professional assistance, you can consider hiring cleaning services from our company, \"Take Your Time.\" We guarantee results and prompt service from our specialists.",

  "blogs_text_12": "Many modern residents mistakenly believe that cleaning is not just a service that makes life easier and saves a lion's share of time on cleaning, but an event that brings more discomfort than benefits. At the same time, the most common misconception is that the owner of the apartment must be present and fully control the process. This may be due to fears about the safety of property or emotional discomfort, as not everyone can entrust their home to a stranger. To delve deeper into whether you need to be present at home when ordering cleaning, the specialists from our company \"Take Your Time\" have prepared this article.\n\n{What is professional cleaning?}\nMany housewives prefer to tidy up on their own, turning cleaning into a real ritual, without which, it seems, order will not be ideal. This is justified if you have plenty of free time and finances, however, it is extremely costly if there is neither the desire nor the cleaning inventory.\nStaying at home during cleaning is absolutely not necessary. You can even leave the keys with the specialists for a long time and go away, asking the masters to close the doors and leave the keys in the mailbox or with the neighbors. In any case, before starting the cleaning, a specialist will come to you to assess the scope of work and provide information on the cost. If necessary, the cleaner will contact you by phone half an hour before the end of the work for you to personally approve the job.\nIf you plan to be present during the apartment cleaning, the cleaners will not object either. Moreover, it's a great opportunity to see the work of the specialists firsthand and pick up some life hacks.\n\nTo order cleaning of premises of any area at an affordable price, contact our company \"Take Your TIme\" today. In addition, you will be pleased with a wide range of services and favorable cooperation conditions for both regular and new customers.",

  "blogs_text_13": "Why do some people's upholstered furniture look worn out after a short period of use, while others remain like new even after several years? One of the main ways to extend the life of upholstered furniture is proper care both on your own and with the help of professional chemical cleaning experts.\nMost people are not aware of the correct methods of cleaning upholstered furniture. Daily care of upholstered furniture with fabric of any kind, as well as leather, is effective, but the best solution for prolonged use of furniture is to call exclusive chemical cleaning specialists once a year.\n\n{Self-care}\nVacuum cleaning the upholstery with a household vacuum cleaner using various attachments on a regular basis will be an important starting point for self-care. Velour and velvet upholstery should be vacuumed with special care to avoid damaging the pile direction. Self-cleaning will significantly reduce the accumulation of dirt in the fabrics.\nSome of the most prone to contamination areas on upholstered furniture are the headrest and armrests. The cause, usually, is the grease from the head and skin, as human skin produces natural oils to retain moisture. Remember, when you vacuum upholstered furniture, you should also clean the pillows from dust, if possible inside as well. This will help remove dust particles, which surface cleaning cannot provide. Out of habit, we usually have our favorite sitting spot; the problem is, if you don't change the pillows around, you will notice wear and tear on the pillows that are used most frequently.\n\n{Protect the upholstery}\nTo keep the furniture looking beautiful in the long term, protect it from food, drinks, and pet urine. If stains appear, be careful with self-cleaning of the upholstery. Do not use household products on natural fabrics—they are all designed for synthetic upholstery and are not suitable for natural fabrics. The most important thing to know is that silk upholstery, along with grease and oil stains, is most difficult to remove water stains. Additionally, if you rub stains from the furniture, you will remove some of the fabric dye.\n\n{Professional cleaning}\nOver time, professional chemical cleaning of upholstered furniture at home will be necessary. Experts can ensure the beauty and longevity of interior items. A qualified service has different cleaning methods for different fabrics. For upholstered furniture made of expensive natural fabrics, only dry cleaning is recommended by manufacturers.",

  "blogs_text_14": "Ecological cleaning products are produced with the aim of minimizing the negative impact on the natural environment. These are products that typically contain formulations based on natural plant or mineral ingredients, which means they are biodegradable and less toxic to human health and the environment compared to traditional cleaning chemicals.\n\nBiodegradability: Ingredients used in ecological cleaning products naturally decompose in the environment, reducing the burden on ecosystems.\n\nAbsence of harmful chemical substances: Ecological cleaning agents often contain natural substances such as sodium acetate, essential oils, citric acids, or baking soda, instead of strong detergents and toxic chemicals.\n\nLow emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs): Most traditional cleaning agents may emit volatile organic compounds, which can harm indoor air quality. Ecological products are often low-emission or VOC-free.\n\nMinimal packaging: Companies producing ecological cleaning products often strive to minimize packaging and use materials from renewable sources to reduce waste and resource consumption.\n\nEffectiveness and safety: Despite their environmental friendliness, ecological cleaning products are as effective as their traditional counterparts. Moreover, their low toxicity means they are safer for users and can be used in homes with children and pets.",

  "blogs_text_11": "Carpet cleaning involves the removal of any dirt and stains using specialized products and equipment. Instead of plain water, organic solvents are used here, capable of cleaning the stain without harming the material. This service is often needed for cleaning carpets, other textiles, or upholstered furniture, as fabrics require the extraction of dirt from deep layers. Order carpet cleaning at home from our company \"Take Your Time\" at the most affordable price.\n\nCarpet cleaning allows for the treatment of pile products of any height, thanks to special equipment. Typically, professional chemicals come in the form of powder or foam for dry cleaning. If wet carpet cleaning is required, specialists use a special shampoo, water, and a rotary machine. In this case, the powder or foam is evenly distributed over the surface, left for some time, and then removed with a wet vacuum cleaner. If the pile is flattened after carpet cleaning, cleaners will use a special brush, and the carpet will look completely new. Note that dry carpet cleaning is almost never used today because the particles of the product are harmful to human health.\n\nWet cleaning is done slightly differently – first, shampoo whipped into foam is applied to the surface, rubbed with a rotary machine, and, if necessary, collected with a wet vacuum cleaner. It is worth noting that the latter point is not used often as it leads to rapid wear of the carpet, however, for new products, it is optimal.\n\nIf necessary, you can also order carpet and upholstery cleaning at home, which is also carried out by dry or wet methods. In the first case, powder is used, and dirt is collected with a vacuum cleaner, while the second is done using a wet vacuum cleaner or steam cleaner. Note that, as with carpets, upholstery cleaning is effective when choosing a wet or steam cleaning method, as dry carpet cleaning leaves fine powder particles on the surface.\n\nIn our company \"Take Your Time,\" you can order any cleaning services, as well as carpet cleaning at home, all at once. We highly value your trust, so we strive to make everything impeccable.",
